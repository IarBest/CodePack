# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

This file captures the current state of the project and ongoing plans. Update
this file after each significant change so that future sessions know what has
already been implemented and what tasks remain.

## Summary

CodePack is an Electron desktop app that merges multiple source files into a
single text file and can split such bundles back to their original structure.
It features a two-column interface with "Merge" and "Split" tabs, drag & drop,
a tree view with checkboxes, persistent settings, and a CodeMirror-based code
viewer/editor. Translations exist for English, Russian and Romanian.

Recent work added a .gitignore, improved localization strings, and implemented a
CodeMirror viewer with navigation and search.

## Planned Work

- Polish existing features and fix minor issues.
- Implement fullscreen mode in the code viewer.
- Complete missing translation keys (e.g., Romanian `menu_format`).
